# PCG
From my PCG class at UCSC, Winter 2015. All the pretty particles or words or pictures were done 
by me. The framework that was provided to make all these pretty designs wad written by 
Kate Compton, the instructor and all other sources provided are written in the idividual README's
if necessary.
